# FastAPI 101

## Introduction

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a python framework to have HTTP server with lots of typing,
during the project I will try to set up database and also commands for doing common commands.

## How to run?

You can run server using `uvicorn` directly,

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

or you can run it using the cli

```bash
python main.py serve
```
